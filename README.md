# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository contains the following submission files:

1) A tidy data set 
2) A Github repo link with script for performing analysis
3) A code book that describes the variables, data, and any transformations performed to clean up the data

## Background Information on Data Set

* Subject group of 30 individuals between 19 and 48 years old participated in experiments that gathered their activities of daily living (ADL) while wearing waist-mounted smartphones with embedded inertial sensors. (Source: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

* Training data is based on 70% of individuals, while test data is generated by the remaining 30%

## R Script - "run_analysis.R"

This R script achieves the following:

1. Merges the training and test sets to create one data set
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set ("tidyData.txt") with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
